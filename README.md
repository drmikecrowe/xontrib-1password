## Installation

To install use pip:

```xsh
xpip install xontrib-1password
# or: xpip install -U git+https://github.com/drmikecrowe/xontrib-1password
```

The xontrib will get loaded automatically.

## Usage

Store your passwords in [1Password](https://1password.com/) and setup [`op` CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/) locally.
Then:
```xsh
$XONTRIB_ONEPASS_ENABLED = True
$MYKEY = OnePass("op://path/my/key")
$MYKEY
# My key value.

$XONTRIB_ONEPASS_ENABLED = False
$MYKEY
# op://path/my/key
```

## Examples

## Good to know

### Disable autoloading

```xsh
$XONTRIBS_AUTOLOAD_DISABLED = ["1password", ]
# if you have set this for other xontribs, you should append the value
```

### Get certain key

Because of the URL is basically `op://<Vault>/<title>/<field>` to find this, here's the commands you can use to determine these fields:

```sh
op item list --format json | jq '.[].title | select(. | contains("OpenAI"))' 
# "OpenAI-API-Key"
op item get OpenAI-API-Key --format json | jq '.fields[] | select(.type == "CONCEALED") | .label'
# "api-key"
```
